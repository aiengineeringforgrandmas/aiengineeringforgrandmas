## I ❤️ Making AI More Accessible for Beginners! 
I believe that AI should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or income level.  The AI Engineering for Grandmas project is a tiny step towards that vision.

## I also ❤️ Creating Easy to Follow Step by Step Documentation! 
Good documentation is essential for beginners as well as for fully deployed into production products.  Every AI Engineering for Grandmas app repository features comprehensive documentation.  I truly hope that you find them Easy to Follow and useful. - Gregory
